# PIMAIndiansDiabetesPrediction
Our main goal is to accurately predict if a patient has diabetes or not based on several different factors which include blood glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin , BMI , age and number of pregnancies.  The results from this project can be used on wearable devices that monitor some of the important parameters with which we can detect diabetes such as blood oxygen meter which was recently introduced in apple watch series 6.

What is zomato and why we chose it ?
Zomato is an application which aggregates the restaurants and a food delivery app which offers many services for their customers. Zomato is more focused into the food ordering industry which is located in India. 

It uses a mobile application which enables people to view restaurants nearby and allowing them to order from a restaurant of their choice.	

Zomato was first introduced as an app which was used to find restaurants and people would critique the restaurants based on several parameters such as location, food, ambience, cost, and best service offered.	

Later Zomato expanded their services when they entered the food delivering industry and now it is one of the top companies in India which competes with other food delivery applications such as uber eats, swiggy, and food panda.	

Zomato also offers monthly and yearly subscription for their customers which provides great benefits to their customers such as one plus one offer in dining at selected restaurants per day. Discounts for customers if they use their membership and order food through their app.

From marketing perspective, it is interesting to see the factors which has influence in the popularity of a restaurant. 

Our dataset contains Bangalore restaurant reviews. Bangalore is a famous city, and it is without a doubt one of the best cities which offers an amazing quality of food and food services at the restaurants. 

We chose Zomato, because Zomato has compiled every restaurants info in their database and people can view the reviews for each restaurant in case if they are planning to dine in or order food through the mobile application.

Objective
Our main goal is to accurately predict the rating of a restaurant based on several different factors such as restaurant name, location, type of restaurant, name, online order, online table booking, votes, average cost and cuisine.

This will help us understand what all factors to consider while starting a new restaurant and make it successful.
