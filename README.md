# PIMAIndiansDiabetesPrediction
Here main goal is to accurately predict if a patient has diabetes or not based on several different factors which include blood glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin , BMI , age and number of pregnancies.  The results from this project can be used on wearable devices that monitor some of the important parameters with which we can detect diabetes such as blood oxygen meter which was recently introduced in apple watch series 6.

What is diabetes ?

Diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. This is caused because of higher-than-normal blood sugar levels which is because of pancreas not secreting enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar level.

Undiagnosed diabetes can be fatal and can damage eyes, nerves, kidneys and other vital organs. 

There are two  types of diabetes:

Type 1 diabetes : this type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that disturbs the regular insulin generation cycle.

Type 2 diabetes : This type of diabetes is when the body becomes resistant to insulin, It also does not accept insulin injected externally, which causes sugar build up in blood. 

Why I chose Diabetes as my project topic ?

Intrigued by the fact that close 420 million worldwide suffer with diabetes.

Given the fact that diabetes can be dangerous if not diagnosed at an early stage. With proper treatment the patient can continue to live life normally with minor dietary modifications.

Another motivation for us to choose diabetes is because we know of people among friends and family that have diabetes. 

This made us wonder what we could do to improve the current process of diabetes prediction.

Using machine learning will improve the accuracy with which we can predict if a patient has diabetes or not based on different factors.
